# Whatsapp Web Shortcuts

A clone of [Whatsappium](https://github.com/MichaelAquilina/Whatsappium), with updated selectors

My own use case:

- Used with Rambox, which allows custom Javascript Injection

-----------

Currently supports:

* `Alt + Up` - Move to previous conversation
* `Alt + Down` - Move to next conversation
* `Alt + K` - Search contacts and chat
* `Alt + J` - Open Emoji window
* `Alt + Left` + `Alt + Right` - Navigate Emoji Tabs when open
